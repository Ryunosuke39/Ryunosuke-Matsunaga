                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">Hi, My name is Ryunosuke Matsunaga, graduated University of Technology Sydney in June 2024, currently looking for any position to kick start my software developper journey in Australia.</p>
                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">I have a degree of bachelor of science in games development, yet my knowledge is not only specified to games development. I have listed two frontend web application projects that I developed. Click image to access projects hosted online.</p>
                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">Throughout my university studies, I have built a strong foundation in web development, AI, algorithms, and data structures. To further solidify my knowledge, I have completed three CS50 courses: 'Introduction to Computer Science,' 'Web Programming with Python and JavaScript,' and 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.' These courses have provided me with a robust understanding of the core principles and have allowed me to apply this knowledge through active, project-based learning.</p>
                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">I hold a 485 post-study visa, valid until June 2028, which authorizes me to work in Australia without restrictions. I am available to start work immediately.</p>
                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">I am currently living in Sydney, NSW, but I am willing to relocate anywhere near the office once I secure a position.</p>
                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">I was born and raised on a small island called <a class="iriomote" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iriomote">"Iriomote"</a>, where I lived until I was 15. Due to the lack of a local high school, I moved to Okinawa to continue my education, eventually graduating at 18. Inspired by my father's experience as a diver in Australia in the late '80s, I decided to pursue higher education in Australia, where I graduated from a local university. This journey has been challenging but immensely rewarding, and I am grateful for the support and encouragement of my parents.</p>
