                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">I am holding a 485 post-study visa (valid until 2028). Legally authorized to work in Australia without any restrictions. Ready to start a job anytime!</p>
                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually working out (lost 20kg since last year! ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ), running, hanging out with my friends, or speedrunning any game I bought to participate in a Speed Run Event soon!</p>
                        <p class="breif_intro_contents">For anyone who wants to learn more about my background, I was born and grew up on a small island called <a class="iriomote" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iriomote">"Iriomote"</a>. I spent my time there until I was 15 years old. Then, I went to Okinawa for high school because there was none on my island. I graduated from high school at the age of 18. Since my father worked as a diver in Australia in the late '80s and recommended me to go there, I came to Australia, graduated from a local university, and here I am! It was surely a challenging journey, but I really appreciate my parents pushing me in this direction!</p>
